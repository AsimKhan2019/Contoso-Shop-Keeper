# SaaSApp-ContosoShopkeeper
The focus of this quick start is on leveraging Elastic Pools and understanding how the support the backend for a SaaS application like Contoso ShopKeeper, the design and implementation of the App Services component is considered out of scope.  Since the best way to understand the behavior of Elastic Pools is to experience using them under load, we provide a load generator. The load generator is a console application that targets one or more elastic database instances in an Elastic Pool with a specific write load. You can run multiple instances of the load generator with different settings if you want to create a blended load, e.g., a mix of heavy a light load. In addition, you do not need to target all databases in the pool by the load generator, so you can leave databases you choose without any load.
